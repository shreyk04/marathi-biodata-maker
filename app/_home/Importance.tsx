          Marriage Biodata Format in Marathi is a collection of information
          about a boy or girl given in the Marathi language while searching for
          a suitable life partner.
          <br />
          <br />
          In simple words, for marriage, the information of a boy or girl is
          arranged in a very nice way in a specific format; we call it Marriage
          Biodata Format in Marathi.
          <br />
          <br />
          Biodata format for marriage in Marathi is pdf, image, and word file
          which contains information about a boy or girl.
          <br />
          <br />
          In Marathi, marriage biodata is also known as lagnacha biodata or
          parichay patra.
          <br />
          In our Maharashtrian culture, when a boy and a girl are of
          marriageable age, they want to find a suitable partner. Their
          acquaintance sends their information to each other to find the right
          partner.
          <br />
          <br />
          Suppose marriage biodata is to send in digital form. In that case, it
          is in the image, pdf, or word file format, and if it is to give
          physically, then it is in hard copy, i.e., printed PDF.

          Why is it necessary to prepare biodata for marriage in Marathi?
        </h1>
        <p className="text-muted-foreground">
          To find the perfect life partner, you should know everything about the
          person who will be with you for the rest of your life. <br />
          <br />
          So relatives from both sides share girl or boy details while meeting.
          These details send to each other online, i.e., through email,
          WhatsApp, or other social media apps. <br />
          <br />
          If the marriage biodata is to be sent online, then it is sent in
          digital format, i.e., image and PDF format, and if it is to be sent
          physically, then it is sent in hard copy, i.e., PDF printout. <br />
          <br />
          The main reason for making a marriage biodata in Marathi is that two
          people who live with each other throughout their lives understand the
          complete information about each other from the biodata. <br />
